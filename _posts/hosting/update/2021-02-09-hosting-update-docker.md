It is recommended that users [pull the tags pointing to specific passbolt versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/passbolt/passbolt/tags) when running in environments other than testing.

To update passbolt, you would just need to change the image tag in your docker-compose.yml file:

```
 image: passbolt/passbolt:<IMAGE_TAG>
```

Then relaunch your docker containers:

```
$ docker compose up -d
```

By doing this:

* a new passbolt docker image will be pulled and a new container created
* your passbolt database schema will be updated
